    "# Predicting Credit Card Approvals\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial banks receive _a lot_ of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning and in this workbook, an automatic credit card approval predictor was built using machine learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is a small subset of the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository showing the credit card applications a bank receives. This dataset has been loaded as a `pandas` DataFrame called `cc_apps`. The last column in the dataset is the target value."
